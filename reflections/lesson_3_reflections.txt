- When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To make my code available online and also share with others.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
Because some changes that may be made in the remote repository could intefere in my changes.

- Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: A kind of clone created in github to be use to callaborate
Clone: Make a copy of a repository
Branch: Create new 'branch' of the development process, e.g., working in bug in one branch and in a new feature in 
another branch

- What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To access the most actual code without having internet and prepare your changes to me submitted in a remote branch

- How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Probably by sending individual files where changes were made to the main developer. Everything would be harders, 
too hard to keep a good history of changes.

- When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each 
approach have?
To develop a new feature or solve a bug until its result does not cause side-effects and truly performs what was 
intented to do.
